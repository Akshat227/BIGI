## 🧠 What even *is* BIGI?

**BIGI** is a beautiful mess of code, chaos, and creativity.  
A humble SDL window with some pixels movin’, ideas groovin’, and *zero* promises of sanity.

---

## 🚀 Features (if you can call them that)

- ✨ Opens an SDL window  
- 🔁 Probably rotates something  
- 🌊 Might bounce stuff with sine waves (because we’re fancy like that)  
- 💥 Code that *just works*… sometimes  
- 🔧 Built with raw energy and a dream (and C++)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- `C++`
- `SDL2`
